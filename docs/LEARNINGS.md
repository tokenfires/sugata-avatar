# Learnings

Hard-won knowledge that is not obvious from the code and would be expensive to rediscover.
Written for a successor with no memory of the sessions that produced it.

Two kinds here: **how to verify things** (which has repeatedly been the difference between
working and merely appearing to work) and **specific technical traps**.

---

## Part 1 — Verification lessons, in order of how much they cost

### 1.1 A gate that has never failed is not known to work

Every gate must be **sanity-checked in both directions** before it is trusted: run it against
known-bad input and confirm it *fails*, naming the defect.

Worked example. `verify_glb.mjs` passed on five figures for two full phases. It asserted morph
names on the body mesh only. Meanwhile **five of six meshes were unskinned** and **all six
materials exported `alphaMode: BLEND`** — the face came apart the moment a bone moved, and teeth
drew through closed lips. Both defects leave the body mesh perfect, so the gate stayed green
through both.

After the fix the gate was run against the *old* GLBs: `FAIL — 22 problem(s)`, naming each one.
That is the check that makes a gate trustworthy. Do it every time.

### 1.2 Structural correctness is not visual correctness

Phase 0's gate proved the morphs existed and were named correctly. It never proved the mesh
**renders correctly**. Those are different properties and only one was gated.

If an artifact will ultimately be judged by eye, **something must look at it**, early.

### 1.3 A metric a frozen image passes trivially is measuring nothing

The capture tool scored **perfectly byte-reproducible** while rendering a *still pose* — stopping
the frame loop had also stopped the skinning update, so the body froze while the eyes blinked and
the HUD animated. A still image is always perfectly reproducible.

Caught only by cross-checking rendered head yaw against the simulation's known 33.5°.

**Ask of any green metric: what would a degenerate input score here?**

### 1.4 The observation window is itself a gate parameter

Postural event rates are 0.5–1/min. A 20-second clip **structurally cannot contain** a weight
shift, a shoulder settle, or an arm swing. Two judges assessed "does this read as a person
waiting?" on a clip that excluded, by construction, the behaviours that most sell it.

Worse: the weight-shift relay was verified as *wiring* and never as *behaviour*, because it never
fired. **Before measuring a rate-limited behaviour, check the window is longer than the period.**

### 1.5 Adversarial verification pays for itself, but only if it re-executes

The pattern that works: **build → adversarial verify by execution → fix**. The verifier is
instructed to assume the claim is overstated, to re-run the commands rather than read the report,
and to specifically hunt fabricated benchmark numbers.

Findings that only re-execution caught:
- A "critical" vite alias that was **inert** (byte-identical bundle without it) *and* a landmine
  that would have hard-failed the first Phase 3 addon.
- A selftest gating `new Sway({weightShiftsEnabled: false})` — a configuration no consumer would
  construct. The default failed its own gate on **9 of 9** runs with the anisotropy inverted.
- One fabricated corroboration: `jawOpen` "moves 2,543 vertices, exactly the research figure."
  It moves 2,239. The 2,543 is pre-helper-removal. The agent reached for a number to confirm a
  result rather than measuring it.

**Verifiers found zero invented constants in code, but several in prose.** Numbers in commentary
get less scrutiny than numbers in expressions. Check the comments.

### 1.6 Root causes are often in the dependency, not in our code

Two of the worst bugs were in how a library behaves, and no amount of staring at our code would
have found either:
- MPFB2's `add_mhclo_asset` only rigs an asset **when a skeleton already exists**; otherwise it
  silently parents without an armature modifier. Our pipeline attaches face parts *before* the
  rig by design, so everything took the unrigged branch.
- Blender 5.2 **no longer uses `blend_method`** for glTF export. The exporter reads the Principled
  BSDF alpha socket directly, and MPFB wires an alpha map into it unconditionally.

**When behaviour is inexplicable, read the dependency's source.** Both were found that way.

### 1.7 Check the frame of reference before tuning

Sway's anisotropy inverted as the window grew. It was not a tuning error: Duarte's weight-shift
amplitudes are **centre-of-pressure**, and the layer realised them 1:1 as **head excursion**. A
weight shift is a pelvis event with a trunk counter-lean; the head follows a fraction (~0.20).
Because Duarte's ML shifts are the *larger* ones while the sway literature's ML is the *smaller*
one, the error compounded until the ratio flipped.

**A published number carries a frame of reference. Ask what it was measured on.**

### 1.8 Conceptual model errors look like missing features

The lower body had **exactly 0.0000 mm** of motion over 600 frames. `Sway` declared only spine,
chest and neck — postural sway was modelled as a **spine bend**. Real quiet stance is an
**inverted pendulum about the ankles**; the whole body leans and the spine barely participates.

The fix is not "add leg bones," it is re-rooting the model so head excursion becomes an *output*.
The distinction matters: bolting on legs would have kept the wrong physics.

### 1.9 Judges must state what they could not observe

The best judgements in this project ended with an explicit limits statement — *"I have not watched
this thing animate in real time with my own eyes; I have watched it frame by frame and measured
it."* That honesty is what let the next round fix the **instrument** rather than the symptom.

**Require it. A judge that only reports findings is hiding its blind spots.**

### 1.10 The per-pixel temporal-σ heat map is the single best motion diagnostic

Accumulate per-pixel variance across a clip and render it. The dead lower body showed as a hard
horizontal cut at the hip line, unmissable, in one image. Generate one for every motion gate.

## Part 2 — Technical traps

### three.js (verified at r185)

- **Do NOT alias `three` → `three/webgpu`.** Both re-export from a shared `three.core.js`, so
  there is no dual-instance problem to solve. The alias omits `UniformsUtils`, `ShaderChunk`,
  `WebGLRenderer` and four others that 30+ stock addons import.
- `PostProcessing` → **`RenderPipeline`** as of r183.
- `RGBELoader` deprecated since r180 → use `HDRLoader`.
- `PCFSoftShadowMap` deprecated at r186; already removed from the WebGPU path.
- 🚩 **Two unrelated things are called SSS.** `MeshSSSNodeMaterial` is a back-lit translucency
  hack (not a skin shader). `addons/tsl/display/SSSNode.js` is Screen-Space **Shadows**.
- `TAARenderPass` (WebGL) **is not TAA** — no reprojection. Useless for an animated avatar.
  The real one is `TRAANode`, WebGPU only.
- Specular AA is **geometric only** — normal-map detail contributes nothing to roughness. Micro-detail
  and hair *will* shimmer without a hand-rolled normal-variance term.
- No bent normals, no specular occlusion, no cloth, no hair, no eye shader. All hand-rolled.
- Bone masking: **filter `clip.tracks`**. Never touch `_propertyBindings` (forum hack, will break).
- `CCDIKSolver.iteration` defaults to **1** in code, not 5 as documented.
- Morph targets live in a `DataArrayTexture` — **no 8-target limit**, and they are nearly free
  (measured 0.219 ms for 69 targets).
- three's node clock reads `performance.now()` — wall-clock re-enters through the renderer. Pin it
  for deterministic capture.

### The figure asset

- Six meshes: `Human` (body, 89 morphs), `teeth_base` (27), `tongue01` (28), `eyelashes01` (27),
  `eyebrow001` (49), `low-poly` (**eyeballs** — named for topology, not anatomy).
- **65 of 89 morphs live on more than one mesh.** Setting a morph means writing every location.
- 53-bone `game_engine` rig. 🚩 **No jaw bone, no eye bones** — face is entirely morph-driven.
- Blink saturates at **0.735**; past that the lash cards punch through the lid.
- Bind pose is worse than an A-pose: arms 41.8° out, 43.1° elbow flexion, wrists 17 cm clear of hips.
- Gender axis is **exactly linear** (2.2e-13 mm). Blending adjacent bakes deviates 0.0004 mm in
  shape. The research's "clamp to a narrow band" mitigation is unnecessary with bracketed bakes.

### LM Studio

See `research/lm-studio-integration.md`. Two blockers: **schema-constrained output arrives in
`reasoning_content`, not `content`**, and thinking **cannot be disabled** by any documented path,
so the schema constraint is load-bearing rather than optional. ~0.7 s per call.

**Environment:** MacBook Pro, Apple M5 Max, 40 GPU cores, 128 GB. Node 24.13.1. Blender 5.2.0 LTS.
ffmpeg 8.1.2. Playwright 1.62.1. Chrome reports `webgpu` / `apple metal-3`.

⚠️ `npm init` **cannot** derive a package name from this directory (non-ASCII character).
`package.json` is hand-maintained. Editing it with Python `json.dumps` will escape the 姿 —
pass `ensure_ascii=False`.

## Part 4 — The workflow pattern that works

```js
phase('Build')
const built = await parallel([ /* 3-4 agents, DISJOINT FILE OWNERSHIP */ ])

phase('Verify')
const checks = await parallel([
  adversarialVerifier(built),   // re-executes; assumes claims overstated
  visualJudge(built),           // opens a browser, looks, judges against the gate
])
```

What makes it work:
- **Disjoint file ownership per agent.** Stated explicitly in every prompt. Zero collisions so far.
- **Give agents the measured constants** and tell them not to invent numbers already in `research/`.
- **Tell them an honest failure report beats a plausible partial claim.** They comply, and it is
  the most valuable output.
- **Separate the builder from the judge.** Builders are systematically optimistic about their own work.
- Verifiers should **not fix anything** — report only. Mixing the roles loses the signal.

Cost so far: ~4.4M subagent tokens across four workflows for Phases 0–2.
